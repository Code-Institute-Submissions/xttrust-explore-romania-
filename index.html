                Romania is a country of southeastern Europe whose national capital is Bucharest. 
                It has a rich and diverse history, influenced by various cultures and 
                civilizations that have shaped its identity and heritage. 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Romania's earliest inhabitants were the Thracians, who settled 
                  in the Carpathian-Danube region around 2000 BCE and intermingled 
                  with the native Neolithic peoples. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Romania's territory was part of the ancient kingdom of Dacia, 
                  which was conquered by the Roman Empire in the 2nd century CE and 
                  became a province of Rome. The Romanization of the Dacians led 
                  to the emergence of the Romanian language, a Romance language 
                  derived from Latin. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Romania's modern state was formed in 1859 through a personal 
                  union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, 
                  which gained their independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Romania joined the Triple Alliance in World War I and fought against 
                  the Central Powers, but switched sides in 1916 and joined the Entente. 
                  After the war, Romania gained new territories from Austria-Hungary and Russia, 
                  becoming the largest country in Southeastern Europe. 
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Romania faced political and social turmoil in the interwar period, 
                as well as the rise of fascism and authoritarianism. In World War II, 
                Romania allied with Nazi Germany and participated in the invasion of 
                the Soviet Union, but changed sides again in 1944 and joined the Allies. 
                After the war, Romania became a communist state under the influence of the Soviet Union.

            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>
              The Romanian language is a Romance language, descended from Latin, 
              and is the most significant cultural identifier for Romanians. 
              It has its unique features, and the Cyrillic script was used for 
              writing Romanian in the past, but the Latin alphabet is now standard. 
              The language carries a rich literary tradition, with notable figures 
              like Mihai Eminescu and Ion CreangÄƒ.

              Romanian culture is deeply rooted in folklore and traditional customs. 
              Folk music, dance, and storytelling play a vital role in preserving 
              the country's heritage. The traditional Romanian blouse, known as the "ie," 
              is a symbol of national pride, and each region has its own unique patterns and designs.

              The majority of Romanians are Eastern Orthodox Christians, and the church 
              has a significant influence on the culture and daily life of the people. 
              Religious festivals and traditions are widely observed, and religious 
              art and architecture are prevalent throughout the country.

          <div>
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>

              Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque, reflecting its complex history. 
              The iconic painted monasteries of Northern Moldova are UNESCO World
