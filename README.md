## Design Choices

### Fonts

To diversify the font choices beyond the standard options, I've integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a typeface that complements the website's aesthetic. For the main text, I've opted for [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") due to its sharp, simple, and easily legible appearance. To make headings stand out, I've applied "Open Sans" with a sans-serif fallback.

### Icons

As for icons I decided to use for my website [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").

### Colors

As for colors I decided to use the same colors as the Romanian National flag. I have picked [Colorcombos](https://www.colorcombos.com/combomaker.html?design=cupcakes&output_width=100&size_option=element&colors=3A71C5,E9EB0A,E31616,DEE2E6,#FFFFFF,0D1B2A&background_color=FFFFFF&show_hex_flag=Y "colorcombos") to generate my own set of colors.

I will explain the uses of the various colors below, starting from top to bottom.

![Colors Pallet](wireframes/colors.jpg)

- #3a71c5 - This color will be used for links and hover effects.
- #e9eb0a - This colors will be used for borders and for styling the "Romania" word
- #e31616 - This colors will be used for headings
- #dee2e6 - This colors will be used for shadows, nav links, footer links, and text
- #ffffff - This colors will be used for sections backgrounds
- #0d1b2a - This colors will be used for background

### Structure

My website development will follow a mobile-first strategy, focusing on creating a visually appealing design for smaller screens. Specifically, I'll begin styling for the iPhone 5, which has a width of 320px. To ensure responsiveness, I'll rely on the predefined screen size breakpoints provided by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes

I opted for [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") for wireframing to visually structure and plan the layout and design of my website, aiming to provide a user-friendly experience and maintain design consistency across different devices.

The wireframes are below:

# Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive. Since the navbar is fixed to the top it provides to user a way to navigate the website very easy, making it a user-friendly

- Desktop (>=992px)
  \
  &nbsp;
  ![Navigation bar](wireframes/navbar-992.png)

      -   A blue hover effect is used to visually highlight active, clicked, and hovered links, making it clear to users when they are interacting with these elements.

      ![Navigation bar on hover](wireframes/navbar-hover-992.png)

- Small devices (<576px)

  - When the screen width is less than or equal to 576 pixels, the navigation bar adopts a hamburger-style menu, maintaining responsiveness across all devices.

![Nav bar on small devices](wireframes/navbar-mobile-close.png)

    - When pressed, it opens the main menu with all available links.

# Refactor

After the refactor some of the design changed. See details below.

- The attractions section has a hover effect of a blue-box-shadow of 3px to distinguish from the others.

![Refactor hover effect](wireframes/attractions-hover-refactor.jpg)

- In the cuisine section the images have a padding of 3px.

![Refactor images padding](wireframes/cuisine-img-padding-refactor.jpg)

- To make the user experience and provide visual cues for the currently viewed section, I've incorporated a hover effect in the menu using scrollspy (Javascript). This idea was inspired by a video I watched on YouTube.
