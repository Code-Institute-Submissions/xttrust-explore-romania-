## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.

### Icons
As for icons I decided to use for my website [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").

### Colors
As for colors I decided to use the same colors as the Romanian National flag. I have picked [Colorcombos](https://www.colorcombos.com "colorcombos") to generate my own set of colors.

I will explain the uses of the various colors below, starting from top to bottom.
