## Design Choices

### Fonts
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used 
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.
In order for headings to stand I have used ("Open Sans", sans-serif).

### Icons
As for icons I decided to use for my website [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").

### Colors
As for colors I decided to use the same colors as the Romanian National flag. I have picked [Colorcombos](https://www.colorcombos.com/combomaker.html?design=cupcakes&output_width=100&size_option=element&colors=3A71C5,E9EB0A,E31616,DEE2E6,#FFFFFF,0D1B2A&background_color=FFFFFF&show_hex_flag=Y "colorcombos") to generate my own set of colors.

I will explain the uses of the various colors below, starting from top to bottom.


![Colors Pallet](wireframes/colors.jpg)


 
 * #3a71c5 - This color will be used for links and hover effects.
 * #e9eb0a - This colors will be used for borders and for styling the "Romania" word
 * #e31616 - This colors will be used for headings
 * #dee2e6 - This colors will be used for shadows, nav links, footer links, and text
 * #ffffff - This colors will be used for sections backgrounds
 * #0d1b2a - This colors will be used for background


### Structure
I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes
As for wireframes I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") for my website. I chose to use wireframes to visually plan and structure my website's layout and design, ensuring a user-friendly experience and consistent aesthetics across different device screens.

The wireframes are below:

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive. Since the navbar is static it provides to user a way to navigate the website very easy, making it a user-friendly

+ Desktop (>=992px)

    ![Navigation bar](wireframes/navbar-992.png)

    -   To distinguish between active, clicked and hovered links, a blue hover effect is applied to the links, providing a visual indication when users interact with them.
